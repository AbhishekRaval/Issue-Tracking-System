# TasksTracker2
TaskTracker2 is like tasktracker 1 with following new added functionality. All TaskTracker 1 Functionality are kept intact. 

* I have created separate registrations for users and managers. Users can work on task, only manager can asssign task to the underlings, underlings can edit and delete taks.
* Manager can only assign tasks to the team he chooses. Manager can select his team from the list of users, which don't have any managers. Moreover he can also remove person from his team, if he feel that user is not working perfectly.
* Manager can view his feeds, where he can see task assigned to him, see his profile, change-team and see task reports
* Manager can have manager above him, but manager can only manage it's underlings. Manager's manager can't manage his underling's  underling.
* Manager can be user too, but user can't be manager.
* Each User can start working on task through interactive button from his feed, which when clicked again will stop the time, record current time and create a new block of time out of it. There is button on each task in feed to check that task's all time blocks, where he can edit and delete it. 

All the features of Tasktracker1 are as follows :

TaskTracker1 is a task tracking application where users can register themselves, login, view tasks assigned to them and also assign tasks to other users.
* The Homepage of Application has a textbox to log in and besides it is two buttons, for login and registration respectively.
* So user can enter the website using their Email, and if they haven't registered it before, they can go and register themselves.
* After Successful Registration or login, users are redirected to Dashboard, where the top of the page displays the welcome heading tag, followed by user account details,  followed by cards -which displays all the information of the task. Edit user details and delete user details are kept at the bottom of the page. The decision for this design choice was made by me because the order of information was necessary. Showing the user details first makes user sure that they logged into the right account, and below it is the cards of tasks which are assigned to him, that makes workflow better. And Edit and Delete User at the bottom makes sense because they'll be used rarely or almost never.
* On the top of the page below user details, there is the option to create a new task, which opens on new page redirect, making UI less cluttered and navigation clean.
* New task has a dropdown where the user can select from the list of users, to assign the particular task. And the user is assigning the task, so it text and it is hardcoded because it makes perfect sense and makes the form look clean. The user can fill in task details and task description, and select from the select group about time interval. Time Interval will be validated in chunks of 15 mins, and it can be 0, because initially when the task is assigned, time spent would be zero. There is a checkbox to mark the task as completed or incomplete, which is convenient!
* When the user click submits button, time validation is done, and if details are okay, he is redirected back to the dashboard, which makes UI cleaned and navigation easy. Also when the task is deleted user is redirected back to Dashboard.
* each card has the option for delete task, edit the task, which when clicked return to dashboard upon success. This way navigation of the entire website is flawless for user experience. 
* on logout and deletion the user is throwed away from system back to homepage of the website.
* The application leverages on storing id of the users in session because, id's are the best representation of the current state of user in database, and also it occupies lesser amount of memory buffer.
